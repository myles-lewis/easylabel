Description: Interactive labelling of scatter plots, volcano plots and 
    Manhattan plots using a 'shiny' and 'plotly' interface. Users can hover 
    over points to see where specific points are located and click points 
    on/off to easily label them. Labels can be dragged around the plot to place 
    them optimally. Plots can be exported directly to PDF for publication.
