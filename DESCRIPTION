Description: Interactive labelling of scatter plots, volcano plots and 
    Manhattan plots using a 'shiny' and 'plotly' interface. Users can hover 
    over points to see where specific points are located and click points 
    on/off to easily label them. Labels can be dragged around the plot to place 
    them optimally. Plots can be exported directly to PDF for publication. For 
    plots with large numbers of points, points can optionally be rasterized as a 
    bitmap, while all other elements (axes, text, labels & lines) are preserved 
    as vector objects. This can dramatically reduce file size for plots with 
    millions of points such as Manhattan plots, and is ideal for publication.
